        <p>Generate panoramas like a pro!</p>
        <p>
        Autopano Pro is an application that helps you create panoramas with only one button. You don't need to select pictures anymore, you don't need to take care about horizontal or vertical lines. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Autopano Pro finds and assembles panoramas alone. It's unbelievably fast, has a strong recognition engine based on SIFT technology, an exclusive color correction system which totally removes colors differences between pictures, and for the first time in the world, full support for HDR stitching. 
        </p>
        
        <p>NOTE: This application is not being developed anymore and the project is officially dead.</p>
